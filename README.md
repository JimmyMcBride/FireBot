# FireBot is a discord bot that does a couple different things for me.
- When new users join one of my servers they get a welcome message based on the which server of mine they joined.
- When new users join one of my servers they have a specific role auto assigned to them based on which server of mine they joined.
- Users in FireScript server have a post in the role-selector channel that allows them to add roles to themselves by liking the emoji's on the post or removing the role by clicking again and removing the emoji.
- FireBot also has a list of message commands you can use. By typing "!about" you will get back a list of commands you can use with FireBot.

# Version 1.1.0 Patch notes
- All current bot functions are finished and working properly.
- Files have been split up for organization purposes and dev commits have been added to code to make more readable and easier to understand.
